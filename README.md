# discord-deno
 🦕 Simple Discord bot in Deno/TypeScript 🦕

## How to launch?
To run the bot you got to execute this command: `deno run --allow-net bot.ts`
- `deno` - the dinosaur m8
- `run` - run command
- `--allow-net` - allowing network access to gateway server
- `bot.ts` - meat of this project

Also make sure you put your Discord bot's token in `token.ts`.

**IMPORTANT TO NOTE:** Coward module is not production ready and, it is barely functional. Using in any important stuff is not advised, for now.
